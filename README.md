# assignment-1-intro-to-machine-learning

This is my solution to the first assignment given in _Intro to Machine Learning_.
In it I implement classification models for handwritten digits (mnist_784), measure their performance and compare between them.
The models are based on (in order of appearance) The Perceptron, Softmax Regerssion and Linear Regression.
